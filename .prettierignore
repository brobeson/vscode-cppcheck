# We turn prettier ignore into prettier include. Start by ignoring everything,
# then add back the files we want Prettier to format, then tell Prettier to
# search subdirectories.

# Ignore everything
*

# Include files by extension
!*.json
!*.md
!*.yaml
!*.yml

# Include files that don't use file extensions

# Check subdirectories
!*/

# Except a build/ subdirectory
